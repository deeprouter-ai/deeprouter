# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory holds one-page records of architectural decisions we've made for DeepRouter + smart-router. Each ADR explains **why** we chose a path, not **how** the code currently works (that's in `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and per-package READMEs).

Read an ADR when:
- You're about to revisit a decision ("why did we do it this way?").
- You want to know what alternatives were ruled out and on what grounds.
- You're an LLM trying to give the user a reasoned recommendation that doesn't accidentally undo a load-bearing decision.

## Template

Each ADR follows:

1. **Title + ID** (`NNNN-kebab-case-name`)
2. **Status** — Proposed / Accepted / Superseded / Deprecated
3. **Date** — when accepted
4. **Context** — what forced the decision (constraint, tension, options)
5. **Decision** — what we chose, in one paragraph
6. **Consequences** — good, bad, and neutral effects
7. **Alternatives considered** — what we ruled out and why
8. **Trigger to revisit** — what would make us reopen this

When updating an ADR, don't rewrite history. If a decision is changing, add a new ADR that supersedes the old one (and set the old one's status to "Superseded by NNNN").
